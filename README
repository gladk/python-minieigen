This is minieigen, small wrapper for the http://eigen.tuxfamily.org library. Home of this project is at http://www.launchpad.net/minieigen/. The code is licensed under the LGPLv3. The author is Václav Šmilauer <eu@doxos.eu>.

Run `python setup.py install` to build & install this module. You will need
the boost_python library to be installed, and Eigen (in /usr/include/eigen3,
or somewhere where the compiler finds it).

To compile by hand, run something like

	g++ -ansi src/miniEigen.cpp -o miniEigen.so -shared -fPIC `pkg-config python --cflags` -lboost_python -I/usr/include/eigen3

Enjoy.
